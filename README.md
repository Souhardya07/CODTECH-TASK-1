# Task - 2 : Model Evaluation and Comparison 

# OVERVIEW OF THE TASK_2

# Through this task I learned about the different types of functions and packages and their use in the process of MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISON.
# In this particular Task I basically took two different AI models and compared them in terms of their precision , accuracy,F1 score.
# For this I have used the pandas and sklearn packages and then I initialised the Two models and evaluated them as we normally do.
# As the final step I compared the two models namely Random forest and SVM and checked for the outputs.
